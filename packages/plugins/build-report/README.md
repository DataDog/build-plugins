# Build Report Plugin <!-- #omit in toc -->

This will populate `context.build` with a bunch of data coming from the build.

```typescript
{
    build: {
        errors: string[];
        warnings: string[];
        // The list of entries used in the build.
        entries ? : {
            filepath: string;
            inputs: Input[],
            name: string;
            outputs: Output[]
            size: number;
            type: string,
        } [];
        // The list of inputs used in the build.
        inputs ? : {
            filepath: string;
            dependencies: Input[];
            dependents: Input[]
            name: string;
            size: number;
            type: string,
        } [];
        // The list of outputs generated by the build.
        outputs ? : {
            filepath: string;
            name: string;
            size: number;
            type: string,
            // Sourcemaps will use Outputs as their Inputs.
            inputs: (Input | Output)[]
        } [];
        start?: number;
        end?: number;
        duration?: number;
        writeDuration?: number;
    };
}
```

## Hooks

### `buildReport`

This hook is called when the build report has been generated.<br/>
It is useful to get the current build's dependency graph for instance.
Happens during the `writeBundle` hook.

```typescript
{
    name: 'my-plugin',
    buildReport(report: BuildReport) {
        // Do something with the data
    }
}
